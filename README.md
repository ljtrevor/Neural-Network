# Neural-Network

This program learns how to recognize handwritten digits using a neural network. 
The neural network has two layers, an input and output layer, no hidden layer, with 784 and 10 neurons respectively.
The network is trained using stochastic gradient descent.
The purpose of this program was to see how neural networks learn and classify the accuracy that could be achieved.

## Dependencies

This program uses python 2.7. It can be downloaded from https://www.continuum.io/downloads.


## Running

Navigate to the directory containing RunThis.py.
Enter: python RunThis.py

This will execute the main function in RunThis.py.

## Credit
This program was created for the University of Victoria's Computer Science 421: Introduction to AI course.
Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael Nielsen was used as the main resource for this program.
Code was used from Michael Nielsen's book. The book can be found at http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html.
